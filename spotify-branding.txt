# Spotify Branding Guidelines for LineupLens

This document contains important guidelines for using Spotify branding elements in LineupLens to ensure compliance with Spotify's Developer Terms and Brand Guidelines.

## Logo Files

For the app to function properly, you need to download and add the following images to your project:

1. **spotify-logo.png** - The official Spotify logo, to be displayed in the "Powered by Spotify" section
2. **spotify-icon.png** - The Spotify icon used next to artist names in the results

## Logo Usage Guidelines

When using Spotify's logo and branding assets, please adhere to these guidelines:

### DO:
- Use the official Spotify logo downloaded from the [Spotify Developer Site](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/design-and-branding/)
- Maintain clear space around the logo (at least the height of the "o" in the logo)
- Use the black logo on light backgrounds or the white logo on dark backgrounds
- Use the logo at a readable size (minimum 24px height)

### DON'T:
- Modify or distort the Spotify logo
- Create new lockups or combinations with the Spotify logo
- Use the Spotify logo as part of a sentence
- Use outdated versions of the Spotify logo
- Create app icons that could be confused with Spotify's own apps

## "Powered by Spotify" Requirements

The app includes a "Powered by Spotify" attribution that:
- Appears on the landing page below the Connect button
- Uses the official Spotify logo
- Follows Spotify's size and spacing requirements

## Spotify API Usage in Your App

When using the Spotify API in your app:
1. Include a clear disclaimer that your app is not affiliated with Spotify
2. Link to Spotify's Developer Terms
3. Don't imply any official relationship with Spotify
4. Send users to Spotify for full playback of music (via the links to artist pages)
